## 🧠 Key Learnings & Challenges Solved

This project helped me understand **real-world deployment issues**, not just local development:

- MongoDB Atlas free-tier cluster auto-pauses after inactivity  
- Debugged backend authentication failures caused by database unavailability  
- Fixed SPA refresh issue (`404 Not Found`) by configuring **rewrite rules** on Render  
- Managed environment variables securely in production  
- Understood the difference between frontend and backend deployment behavior
